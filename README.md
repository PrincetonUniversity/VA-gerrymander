This repository contains a reform map drawn by the Princeton Gerrymandering Project to remedy the unconstitutional districts recently struck down as racial gerrymanders in Bethune-Hill v. Va. State Bd. of Elections (opinion [here](http://electionlawblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Virginia.pdf)). 
On August 30, 2018, the General Assembly will enter a special session to consider proposals from both political parties and the public on how the afflicted districts should be remedied.
We present our map, and its underlying data, as an option for legislators to consider.
Our map was not drawn by someone well-versed in redistricting software, nor was it drawn with any particular desired outcome.
Rather, it sought to restore constitutional order to the district boundaries while drawing districts that were more compact, preserved cities and counties where possible, and followed natural geographic boundaries.
Any underlying partisan effects of the map are incidental and, frankly, unimportant.
What matters is that this map—unlike the map currently in effect—wasn't drawn with a desired outcome in mind.
We did not seek to engineer political outcomes for either political party.
We simply looked at the geography before us, and made our best effort at a fair map.
Rather than making piecemeal changes to the existing map with such ingrained infirmities, we believe legislators should use our map as a base point for any new maps they introduce in the General Assembly.
From our map, they can make changes to comply with other criteria as desired, but their final product will still have originated from a place of fundamental fairness and impartiality.
And that is something all Virginians deserve.
