## Accompanying data and analysis for "A Fresh Start for Virginia Districting"

This repository contains a Reform Map drawn by the Princeton Gerrymandering Project to remedy the unconstitutional districts recently struck down as racial gerrymanders in Bethune-Hill v. Va. State Bd. of Elections (opinion [here](http://electionlawblog.org/wp-content/uploads/Virginia.pdf)). 
On August 30, 2018, the General Assembly will enter a special session to consider proposals from both political parties and the public on how the afflicted districts should be remedied.
We present our map, and its underlying data, as an option for legislators to consider.
Our map was not drawn by someone well-versed in redistricting software, nor was it drawn with any particular desired outcome.
Rather, it sought to restore constitutional order to the district boundaries while drawing districts that were more compact, preserved cities and counties where possible, and followed natural geographic boundaries.
In Hampton Roads, where water is ever present, we sought to ensure that bridges connected every part of a district.
Any underlying partisan effects of the map are incidental and, frankly, unimportant.
What matters is that this map—unlike the map currently in effect—wasn't drawn with a desired outcome in mind.
We did not seek to engineer political outcomes for either political party.
We simply looked at the geography before us, and made our best effort at a fair map.
Rather than making piecemeal changes to the existing map with such ingrained infirmities, we believe legislators should use our map as a base point for any new maps they introduce in the General Assembly.
From our map, they can make changes to comply with other criteria as desired, but their final product will still have originated from a place of fundamental fairness and impartiality.
And that is something all Virginians deserve.

## The Process
While a student at William & Mary Law School, Ben participated in a class which was tasked with a hypothetical redrawing of the 11 challenged districts in the Bethune-Hill case. A press release can be found [here] (https://law.wm.edu/news/stories/2017/law-and-undergraduate-students-use-gis-tools-to-redraw-11-virginia-house-districts.php)). 
Because of his familiarity with the political geography of this region of Virginia (as a resident of the area as recently as May 2018), and his previous use of ArcGIS in redrawing these very same districts, Ben was tasked with drawing our team's Reform Map. 
In drawing the map, he had access to the following data: 
-The existing districting plan, as enacted by the Virginia General Assembly in 2011
-Precinct boundaries for all counties in the 33 impacted districts (the 11 districts that needed to be redrawn, and the 22 districts immediately adjacent to them
-Census block information within each of the above precincts.
-Election results at the precinct level, aggregated to the block level, for the 2016 Presidential Election and the 2017 Lieutenant Governor election.
-Demographic data from the census at the census block level (including, importantly for this case, the African-American voting age population of the blocks and precincts)
-A hydrologic map of major rivers, the Chesapeake Bay, and the Atlantic Ocean
-A road map of Virginia, including everything from major highways to city streets
His process was as follows: 
-First, identify the
